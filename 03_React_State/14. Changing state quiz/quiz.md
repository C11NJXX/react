1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
   
1.setCount(count + 1)

2.setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)

2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

replace the old one with a new version

3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

modify the old one, new version is related with the previous one
