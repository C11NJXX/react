Till now, I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Webpack, and Vite.

And I believe it's time to jump into React!

I learned React in my sophomore year of college, but at that time,
my fundamentals were weak.

Now, everything is different, and Iâ€™m so excited to learn React again!

Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€
